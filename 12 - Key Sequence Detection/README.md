# 12 - Key Sequence Detection

**Challenge:** Learn about key sequencing detection i.e. when someone inputs a certain sequence of keys into your window or into an inputter, store them in an
array, and then check every single time that they key up if it matches what you're looking for.

**Things To Learn:** Keyup event. Array methods push, splice and join.
